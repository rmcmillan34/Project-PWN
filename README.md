# Project-PWN
Project PWN (Portable Wargame NUC) is a cyber range/home-lab designed for taking cybersecurity training on the go.

This project was borne out of the requirement to occasionally travel for work for extended periods without access to fast internet.

This project aims to help upskill me with the required knowledge in building and maintaining a home-lab, and installing and configuring operating systems/virtual networks to create a training environment for practicing ethical hacking concepts.

## Hardware Components
For the hardware component selection, I decided to utilise the Intel NUC platform for its performance and portability. The Intel NUC 9 Extreme also provided an additional ethernet interface to allow for a dedicated hypervisor management port.

I decided to include two storage SSDs, one for the hypervisor and a second to act as bulk storage for the NAS, to serve secure operating systems, vulnerable operating systems, and hacking resources to others who connect to this system.
